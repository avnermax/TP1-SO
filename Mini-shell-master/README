Description:  
----------- 
C implementation of simple shell program.  


Included Files:
--------------
My assignment solution consists of the following files: 
- minishell.c 
- minishell.h 
- minishellfunc.h 
- makefile


Running my solution: 
------------------- 
You can run my assignment as follows: 
> make run  


Compiler:  
------------ 
gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)


Assumptions: 
----------- 
My program can't handle background jobs or processes. So you cannot send job to background 


Conclusions/Remarks: 
------------------- 
I had problems implementing background jobs in simple shell, but i did implemented other
functionalities like < > | redirections


Errors/Bugs: 
----------- 
One error I can not fix/find is that sometime you have to type "quit" 2 time to quit
at it gives no result, after you type "quit" second time minishell quits, this is minor bug,
but it is still there
